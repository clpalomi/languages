Notes
- This BSL 1.1 file is adapted for practical clarity. It preserves the
  core terms (non-production only until the Change Date; converts to
  MIT on the Change Date; redistribution and warranty terms).
- For absolute textual fidelity, you may replace Sections 1–9 with the
  canonical BSL 1.1 text and keep the parameter block above as-is.
